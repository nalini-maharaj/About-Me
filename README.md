# Hi, my name is Nalini! :wave:
## I'm currently a 25 year old recent graduate from the University of Waterloo, with a Bachelor's of Honours Physics and Astronomy.
#### Throughout my degree, I have gained a proficieny in Python. Specifically, I enjoy modelling astronomical data in order to observe patterns in the universe.
## More About Me
In the future, I hope to be able to work in astronomical research about physical phenomena in the universe, such as understanding dark matter and black holes.

I love learning about other cultures and specifically, their languages. Some of the languages that I am at a beginner level in include Japanese, Korean and Italian. Here's a list of some other languages I want to learn:

- [ ] Gujarati
- [ ] Mandarin
- [ ] Arabic
